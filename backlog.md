- Triggers
    - need to set state and type when converting from quartz object
    - see `ExposedTriggersKt#toQuickQuartzTrigger`
- Simplify schema 
    - get rid of `schedName` from PKs
    - reorder to make `jobGroup` | `triggerGroup` the leading key component
    - prune indexes
- Serialization 
    - need fast baos
- Storing jobs
    - handle the replace param when storing 
    - test with payloads on the triggers instead of on the job
